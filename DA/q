     nnvviimm is a text editor based on Vim.
     Start nnvviimm followed by any number of
     options and/or files:

           nvim [options] [file ...]

     Commands in nnvviimm begin with colon
     (‘:’).  Type ":help subject" to get
     help on a specific subject.  Use
     <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects
     (":help cmdline-completion").

     The "quickref" help section is a con‐
     densed reference of editor features:
           :help quickref

     If you are new to Vim/Nvim, start
     with the 30-minute tutorial:
           :Tutor

     After installing/updating Nvim, it's
     a good idea to run the self-check:
           :checkhealth

     _f_i_l_e _._._.    File(s) to edit.  Opens
                 one buffer per file.  To
                 switch between buffers,
                 use the ::nneexxtt and
                 ::pprreevviioouuss commands.

     --           Reads text from standard
                 input until EOF, then
                 opens a buffer with that
                 text.  User input is read
                 from standard error,
                 which should be a termi‐
                 nal.

     --tt _t_a_g      Finds _t_a_g in the tags
                 file, the associated file
                 becomes the current file
                 and the associated com‐
                 mand is executed.  Cursor
                 is positioned at the tag
                 location in the file.

     --qq [_e_r_r_o_r_f_i_l_e]
                 QuickFix mode.  Display
                 the first error in
                 _e_r_r_o_r_f_i_l_e.  If _e_r_r_o_r_f_i_l_e
                 is omitted, the value of
                 the 'errorfile' option is
                 used (defaults to
                 eerrrroorrss..eerrrr).  Further er‐
                 rors can be jumped to
                 with the ::ccnneexxtt command.

     ----          End of options.  Remain‐
                 ing arguments are treated
                 as literal file names,
                 including filenames
                 starting with hyphen
                 (‘-’).

                 Ex mode, reading stdin as
                 Ex commands.  Useful for
                 scripting because it does
                 NOT start a UI, unlike

                 ing because it does NOT

                 ference between two to
                 four files, similar to
                 sdiff(1).  ::hheellpp ddiiffff

     --RR          Read-only mode.  Sets the
                 'readonly' option.  Im‐
                 plies --nn.  Buffers can
                 still be edited, but can‐
                 not be written to disk if
